    <h1>Gameplay Tips</h1>
    <h2>General Gameplay</h2>
    <p>If you can take off, land, and IFF safely, you are ready to fly on Flashpoint Levant.</p>
    <p>All missions are significantly easier with 2+ players.</p>
    <p>You can create and save loadouts in the Mission Editor, and they'll be available as presets in the rearm menu.</p>
    <p>The mission runs for 6 hours at a time, alternating between morning and afternoon versions. You do not lose tickets if you are in the air during a mission restart, but you will have to restart from the ground afterwards.</p>
    <p>Mission progress and destroyed air defenses persist across mission restarts.</p>
    <h2>Survival Mindset</h2>
    <p>Your first and most important objective is to safely return to base.</p>
    <p>If you abort your mission and safely land, your sortie was a success. If you damage your target and safely land, your sortie was a great success. If you destroy your target but are yourself destroyed, your sortie was a failure.</p>
    <p>Your first several flights are likely to end in sudden death from air defenses or missiles you didn't realize were there. Situational awareness and survival mindset is a skill that can be learned.</p>
    <p>Download TacView's free version and review every sortie whether successful or failed. You'll see things in TacView you never realized in the moment.</p>
    <p>Enemy MANPADS (nicknamed "Igladude") are scattered across the map until all ground missions in an area are completed. Always assume there's an Igladude nearby that you can't see. Limit time spent at low speed at medium and low altitude.</p>
    <p>High altitude (at least 21,000 feet) is the safest place from MANPADS, AAA and SHORAD- the higher the better. Low altitude (below 1500ft) is mostly a dangerous place to be, but can be a safe place if you can use terrain to mask from SAM radars - the lower the better, all the way down to 30ft. Medium altitude (1500-22,000ft) is the worst of both, where you can be attacked by every threat.</p>
    <p>Add a <a href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3314315/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threat table</a> with threat ranges to your kneeboard. Compare your mission briefings and RWR to the threat table to know how far or high you can be without being shot at.</p>
    <h2>Situational Awareness</h2>
    <p>Use SRS to listen in on the radio- especially Overlord (136.0 AM) and general (253.0 AM). You'll sometimes hear people ask for help, and can ask others for help. Just listening in can make you more aware.</p>
    <p>Use OverlordBot with a 20-40 mile tripwire for situational awareness.</p>
    <p>Use Sneaker GCI on a second monitor or tablet for even more situational awareness.</p>
    <p>Get your eyes up out of the cockpit looking for threats. With luck you can spot the tracers from AAA or smoke trail from a SAM with enough time to defend.</p>
    <p>Always use at least two methods of IFF before firing on a target.</p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>Always check the F10 map before approaching or entering runways, since not all players use SRS.</p>
    <p>When landing at airfields in potentially enemy territory, you can reduce the risk by evasively maneuvering towards the field, using an overhead break landing pattern and visually inspecting any runway damage during the overhead break.</p>
    <p>You can call an airbase using the built-in DCS ATC system if the runway has been cratered (the ATC will tell you to divert elsewhere). Using the built-in ATC will also turn on the runway lights in IFR conditions.</p>
    <p>Press <code>LAlt+Y</code> on the F10 map to cycle the coordinate system used in the top bar.</p>
    <h2>Ground Strikes</h2>
    <p>Study the F10 map of your target before your strike. Look for key landmarks and unique features you can use to visually identify and orient on.</p>
    <p>If you know the precise location of your target, you can get "satellite reconnaissance" by zooming in over the location on the F10 map, then pressing <code>LCtrl + F11 (F11 Jump to free camera)</code></p>
    <p>Flying straight and level is dangerous. Don't be predictable. Approach targets at an angle for better visibility before the final run in. Jink when egressing at lower altitudes.</p>
    <p>It is safest to hit your target with one strike and leave. A reattack is more dangerous than the first attack.</p>
    <p>Try to complete your ground attack and leave within 45 seconds.</p>
    <p>Large targets like buildings are best attacked with large bombs such as 2000 pounders.</p>
    <p>Buddy lasing is an effective tactic, especially in cloudy weather.</p>
    <h2>Threats</h2>
    <h3>Air Interception</h3>
    <p>Enemy aircraft spawn at enemy controlled airfields to patrol the skies and intercept players.</p>
    <p>Use OverlordBot, Sneaker GCI or a human controller (if available) to maintain situational awareness of enemy aircraft.</p>
    <p>Study a BVR timeline for your aircraft.</p>

    <p>Choose fights that are even or in your favor. You are very likely to lose 1v2, and more likely to win 2v1.</p>
    <p>Your airspeed is your health bar. Keep it high.</p>
    <p>Start engagements at high altitudes. Your missiles fly further in thin air. Altitude can be traded for speed during the fight.</p>
    <p>The aircraft that shoots first usually wins the fight. Start the fight by launching a medium range missile at max range, then cranking. This will force the enemy into defensive maneuvers, creating opportunities.</p>
    <p>The AI is poor at engaging multiple targets in different sectors. When working with a wingman, separate and use different tactics to cover more airspace. You might have one wingman fly lower than the other, or flank an enemy from multiple sides, or separate your attacks in time so that the second aircraft engages just as the first aircraft skates out.</p>
    <p>The best option in a BVR fight is often to turn around and run. You can then either reset, recommit or leave as the situation dictates.</p>
    <p>The AI is less proficient in WVR fights at lower altitudes, especially around mountains. Maneuver kills on AI at low altitudes in mountainous areas are common.</p>
    <p>Fast interceptor aircraft such as the MiG-21 and MiG-25 perform very poorly at low airspeeds. Bait these jets into slow turning fights to nullify their speed advantage.</p>
    <h3>Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS)</h3>
    <p>Igladude is the most dangerous threat in the mission. His 3D model is tiny and blends into the terrain. Once he fires his weapon, your only chance of survival is to spot the smoke trail and release as many flares as possible within a few seconds. Igladude has no fear and no mercy.</p>
    <p>The best defense against Igladude is to stay outside of his range. If you fly at or above 16,500ft AGL Igladude will not fire on you. He also prefers to fire on targets inside of a 2nmi radius, although the missile can reach up to 2.75nmi.</p>
    <p>It is easier to spot the smoke trail if your wingman watches for it while you make your attack run.</p>
    <p>Heading directly towards or away from Igladude is likely to end in death. Moving sideways relative to Igladude while releasing flares provides better opportunities to survive.</p>
    <p>If you know Igladude's exact location, you can bait out his missiles until he runs out of ammo. Orbit him inside his threat radius and watch him like a hawk. As soon as you see the smoke trail from a missile launch, release as many flares as you can, as quickly as possible. (Each time you release a flare, DCS rolls a dice to see if the missile tracks it.) You should see the missile track one of the flares and curve behind you.</p><a href="igladude-tacview.png"><img src="igladude-tacview.png" alt="tacview"></a>
    <p>IR missiles have improved tracking of aircraft at higher throttle settings, so you can pull your throttle out of afterburner to MIL or down from MIL to IDLE to increase your chances.</p>
    <p>Preflaring is of limited effectiveness in DCS because the effect on MANPADS targeting is not well modeled.</p>
    <h3>Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA)</h3>
    <p>AAA can be dangerous to the unprepared pilot, but is easily dealt with with some simple strategies.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to avoid AAA is to stay outside its threat range. The ZU-23 has a relatively short effective range of 1.3nmi or 6,500ft. If you fly at or above 7000ft AGL, you the ZU-23 will not fire on you.</p>
    <p>A skilled pilot can maneuver in three dimensions and dodge the incoming fire. The gun will lead its aim, but by continuously jinking a pilot can dodge incoming fire. This takes practice, so set this up in the Mission Editor and try it out.</p>
    <p>Many AAA systems are vulnerable from diving attacks directly above them. A pop-up attack can ingress at low altitude using terrain as cover, pop up, and dive down from directly above.</p>

    <h3>Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs)</h3>
    <p>Most SAM systems include three components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A search radar</li>
      <li>A track radar</li>
      <li>Multiple launchers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Usually, killing either the search radar or track radar will neuter the site.</p>
    <p>The SA-2, SA-3 and SA-5 cannot engage targets at low altitudes (1500ft AGL for the SA-2 and SA-5, 700ft AGL for the SA-3). Most aircraft can fly under the radar.</p>
    <p>The SA-6 can engage targets down to about 100ft AGL. A skilled pilot can stay under this ceiling.</p>
    <p>The SA-8 can engage targets down to about 50ft AGL, but cannot engage targets above 22,000ft. Stay above this ceiling and attack from standoff range.</p>
    <p>No SAM in DCS can engage an aircraft below 10m (30ft) AGL. Note that this is measured from the ground terrain texture, not from the tops of any trees or buildings. A skilled helicopter pilot can stay under this ceiling.</p>
    <p>When a SAM site fires a missile at you, a good default option is to turn directly away from the missile and accelerate as fast as possible to outrun the missile. However, your best option may vary depending on the aircraft, situation and local terrain.</p>
    <p>You can suppress a SAM site using AGM-88 HARMs or TALDs. Generally, a site will engage the closest missile or aircraft first. An AGM-88 alone may not reliably kill a site, since the site will turn off its radars to blind the missile. However, an AGM-88 can create a window of opportunity to destroy a site using bombs. This strategy is especially effective with two or more aircraft.</p>
    <p>Cluster bombs can be effective at destroying most or all of a site in a single attack.</p>
    <p>High drag bombs can be effective when combined with a low level ingress and well-chosen ripple release settings.</p>
    <h2>CSAR</h2>
    <p>Taftanaz is a convenient airfield to drop off rescued pilots.</p>
    <p>The drop-off works best from the center of the runway.</p>
    <h2>Module Tips</h2>
    <h3>A-4E-C</h3>
    <p>The AN/ASN-41 Navigation Computer and BDHI are useful tools for navigating to your objective. The navigation computer is accurate enough to get you within visual range of your target.</p>

    <p>It's often more useful to carry 60 flares than the default 30/30 chaff/flare mix.</p>
    <p>In mid to late campaign, consider ferrying a lightweight aircraft to Hatay, then arming and refueling for combat. This can be faster than carrying a heavy load all the way from Gaziantep or Akrotiri.</p>
    <h3>A-10A & A-10C</h3>
    <p>You usually don't need 100% fuel in the A-10. 100% fuel is roughly 3 hours of playtime, and most missions take 45 minutes to 2 hours. Launching with 60% fuel can make you more maneuverable or enable larger payloads.</p>
    <p>The A-10's jammer pod is not useful in this campaign. It mildly reduces enemy radar guided SAM range, but A-10s typically avoid those SAMs entirely. An additional 2 AIM-9s for self-defense is a better use of the pylon.</p>
    <p>In mid to late campaign, consider ferrying a lightweight aircraft to Hatay, then arming and refueling for combat. This can be faster than carrying a heavy load all the way from Gaziantep.</p>
    <h3>A-10C</h3>
    <p>When flying BAI missions that involve searching a grid square, you can draw the grid square on the TAD using the CDU's steerpoint and FPM pages. Input the four corners of the grid as steerpoints. Then, create a second flight plan in the FPM page creating a loop of the four corners. Set this flight plan as the current flight plan and set the CDU mode to FLIGHT PLAN. The box should appear on the TAD.</p>
    <p>You can improve the precision of unguided bombs by inputting the wind conditions in the CDU (SYS → LASTE → WND → WNDEDIT). The following table is accurate as of June 2023:</p>
